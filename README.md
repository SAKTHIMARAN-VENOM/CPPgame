#  Space Shooter — Week 1
### Topics: SFML Setup · Game Loop · Player Class · Movement · Delta Time

---

This is the **foundation** of the Space Shooter game. No bullets or enemies yet — just the core architecture every game needs before anything else can be added.

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| SFML window (800×600) | ✅ Done |
| Clean game loop | ✅ Done |
| Delta time (frame-rate independent movement) | ✅ Done |

| Left / Right arrow key movement | ✅ Done |
| Screen boundary clamping | ✅ Done |
| Scrolling star background | ✅ Done |
| Live FPS counter | ✅ Done |

## 🔧 How to Compile

### Linux / macOS
```bash
# Install SFML (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev

# Install SFML (macOS)
brew install sfml

# Compile
g++ main.cpp -o SpaceShooter -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -std=c++17

# Run
./SpaceShooter
```

### Windows (MinGW)
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o SpaceShooter.exe -IC:\SFML\include -LC:\SFML\lib ^
    -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -std=c++17
```

### Windows (Visual Studio)
1. Create an Empty C++ Project
2. Add `main.cpp` to Source Files
3. Project → Properties → C/C++ → Additional Include Dirs → `C:\SFML\include`
4. Project → Properties → Linker → Input → Additional Dependencies:
   - `sfml-graphics.lib;sfml-window.lib;sfml-system.lib`
5. Copy all `.dll` files from `C:\SFML\bin` next to the `.exe`

      └── game.run()
            └── while(window.isOpen())
                  ├── dt = clock.restart().asSeconds()   ← measure frame time
                  ├── processEvents()                    ← check ESC / close
                  ├── update(dt)                         ← move stars + player
                  └── render()                           ← draw everything
```

## 📝 Notes

- The `struct Star` is defined inside the `Game` class — it is only used by the Game so it makes sense to keep it local.
- `ConvexShape` is used for the player hull because it allows any convex polygon, not just rectangles or circles.
- `setFramerateLimit(60)` caps the loop to 60 FPS so the CPU isn't running at 100% unnecessarily.
